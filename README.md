</p>
A personal collection of AI-based scripts and tools that I create for my own needs and share for anyone who might find them useful.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a collection of various AI-based utilities and tools that I develop while learning and working with different AI technologies.
While these scripts are primarily created for my personal use, I'm sharing them here in case others find them helpful for their own projects.

## Note
- Most scripts require specific API keys (like OpenAI)
- Each script has its own requirements and setup instructions
- These tools are created for learning and practical purposes
- Feel free to use and modify them for your needs
